Owns a business in Athlone
I have divided Athlone into 24 separate areas	(ability to add more)
1 delivery person per area
Each delivery area contains a collection of customers
Sorted by housing together

Up at 4
For each delivery area I have a customer book contains a list of customers for each delivery area
Associated with each delivery area - order book
Customers place orders and are recorderd in the order book

Customer a may say they want a certain newspaper at a certain time

Another book - delivery book, for each delivery area I open the order book and iterate over and if there is a valid order for today I transfer it into the delivery book

24 - delivery docket

Every time a change happens its reflected in the system

Each delivery person - their delivery docket

Each delivery person takes their docket and fills up their bag according to the delivery docket

As they deliver they mark the delivery successful or not

At the end of each month I have to create an invoice for each customer
To generate I have to go over each docket to see how many successful deliveries


1-2 of the month the invoices are sent by the delivery drivers

They have to pay within 30 days

Not pay month

1 month invoice
2 month invoice+ reminder
3 month invoice+ suspend delivery

A customer can come in and say they will be absent and that is marked in the order book

Geo stuff later
