Phase 1: Understanding Requirements & Planning
Duration: 1 Week
Goal: Understand what the project needs to do and create a clear plan.
Deliverables: A list of tasks (Product Backlog) organized by priority.

We’ll work together to figure out what the system needs. This will be turned into a list of tasks (user stories) that are easy to follow. The most important tasks will go to the top of the list so we know where to start.

Phase 2: Build the Basics
Duration: 3 Weeks
Goal: Create the main features of the system.
Deliverables: Working parts of the system, fully tested and ready to use.

At the start of each week (Sprint Planning), we’ll decide what to work on. The team will pick a few tasks from the top of the list and complete them by the end of the sprint. Everything we finish will be tested to make sure it works.

Phase 3: Add More Features and Test Everything
Duration: 3 Weeks
Goal: Build extra features, fix bugs, and improve the system.
Deliverables: Additional features and detailed testing reports.

We’ll continue building new features each week while testing everything we’ve done so far. Feedback will help us fix or improve the system as we go.

Phase 4: Final Touches and Delivery
Duration: 2 Weeks
Goal: Finish testing, make the system look good, and get it ready for release.
Deliverables: The final version of the product.

The last sprints will focus on polishing the system, fixing any remaining issues, and improving the user interface. By the end, we’ll have a finished product ready to deliver.

How We’ll Work
Short Sprints: We’ll divide our work into 1-2 week blocks (sprints). Each sprint has a clear goal, helping us stay on track.

Teamwork: During Sprint Planning, each person will pick tasks they are good at. If needed, we’ll pair up to support each other.

Daily Check-ins: We’ll have short daily meetings (15 minutes max) to talk about progress, share problems, and adjust plans.

Task Priorities
We’ll organize our work by importance:

Critical (Must-Have): Main system features like core methods, database setup, and tests.
High (Should-Have): Extra features and improving the design.
Medium (Nice-to-Have): Making the system faster or adding extra details.
Low (Extras): Small improvements like UI polishing.
Each sprint will focus on the most important tasks first.

Dealing with Problems
Flexibility: If something doesn’t go as planned, we can adjust tasks during each sprint to keep things moving.

Feedback & Improvement: After every sprint, we’ll have two meetings:

Sprint Review: Show what we’ve done and get feedback.
Retrospective: Talk about what went well and what could be better for the next sprint.
By doing this, we’ll stay organized and improve as a team.
